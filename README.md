C++ School Project

This project is a scenario based exercise to help an university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language.
Once completed, The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. 
Student data for the program includes student ID, ﬁrst name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete
each course, and degree. The program will read a list of ﬁve students and use function calls to manipulate data. 
While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program.

the project is on going work from my Scripting and Programming class..
